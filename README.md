# SnakeNeuralNet
Trying to learn neural networks with java.


This is a small project in order to learn the fundamentals of neural networks. I'm using a 4-3-1 forward propagation neural network in order to train the snake to go in the right direction. The distance from the apple as well as all of the potential moves are thrown into the calculating in order to predict the best way of achieving a higher score (higher snake size).
